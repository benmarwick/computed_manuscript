# Introduction {#intro}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Here we'll add some references from Zotero [@perkel2020]: [@fisch_omics_2015; @argelaguet_computational_2021; @le_cao_community-wide_2021].

Markdown documents can include inline equations written in \LaTeX, such as $F = ma$. Here is an equation on its own line:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

## Inline computation {#sec:1}

One 'killer feature' of computed manuscripts is the ability to compute and insert values into the text rather than requiring authors to input them manually. That circumvents the possibility that the author will enter an incorrect number, or forget to update them should new data arise. 

For instance, imagine we are analyzing data from a clinical trial. We have grouped subjects in three bins and measured their weights. 

```{r subject-weights, echo=FALSE}
# create a mock dataset
n_subjs <- 99
subjID <- 1:n_subjs

# generate 99 random #s between 1 and 10
tmp <- floor(runif(n_subjs, min = 0, max = 9))
# assign those numbers to any of 3 subject groups
fn <- function(x) { 
  if (x >= 6) 'Group 1' 
  else if (x >= 3) 'Group 2' 
  else 'Group 3' 
}
subj_class <- sapply(tmp, fn)

# pick random weights between 75 and 300
wts <- floor(runif(n_subjs, min = 75, max = 300))
# combine the data into a table
df <- data.frame(ID = subjID, class = subj_class, wt = wts)

# display the table, splitting the 99 rows into 3 cols wide
tmp <- cbind(df[1:33,], rep('|', 33), 
             df[34:66,], rep('|', 33), 
             df[67:99,])
names(tmp) <- c('ID', 'class', 'wt', '|', 'ID', 'class', 'wt', 
                '|', 'ID', 'class', 'wt')
knitr::kable(tmp, format = 'latex', booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = "Original subject data")
```

Rather than analyzing those data and then copying them into our manuscript, we can use the programming language `R` to do that in the manuscript itself. Simply enclose the code inside backticks: `` `r
<code to evaluate>` ``. For instance, to calculate the circumference and area of a circle with radius _r_ = 10, you could write "A = `` `r
pi * r^2` ``" and  "C = `` `r
2 * pi * r` ``. Those give A = `r r = 10; round(pi * r^2, 3)` and C = `r r = 10; round(2 * pi * r, 3)`. 

We have **`r nrow(df)`** subjects in our study (Table \@ref(tab:subject-weights)). The average weight is **`r round(mean(df$wt), 2)`** (range: **`r min(df$wt)`**-**`r max(df$wt)`**). We have **`r df %>% filter(class == 'Group 1') %>% nrow()`** subjects in Group 1, **`r df %>% filter(class == 'Group 2') %>% nrow()`** subjects in Group 2, and **`r df %>% filter(class == 'Group 3') %>% nrow()`** in Group 3. (The numbers in **bold face type** are computed values.)

Now suppose we get another tranche of data:

```{r new-data, echo=FALSE}
# create a mock dataset
n_subjs <- 60
subjID <- 1:n_subjs

# generate 99 random #s between 0 and 10
tmp <- floor(runif(n_subjs, min = 0, max = 9))
# convert those numbers into either of 3 subject groups
subj_class <- sapply(tmp, fn)

wts <- floor(runif(n_subjs, min = 75, max = 300))
df2 <- data.frame(ID = subjID, class = subj_class, wt = wts)

# display the table, splitting the 99 rows into 3 cols wide
tmp <- cbind(df2[1:20,], rep('|', 20), 
             df2[21:40,], rep('|', 20), 
             df2[41:60,])
names(tmp) <- c('ID', 'class', 'wt', '|', 'ID', 'class', 'wt', 
                '|', 'ID', 'class', 'wt')
knitr::kable(tmp, format = 'latex', booktabs = TRUE, 
             caption = "New subject data")
```

There are **`r nrow(df2)`** subjects in this new dataset (Table \@ref(tab:new-data)). Their average weight is **`r round(mean(df2$wt), 2)`** (range: **`r min(df2$wt)`**-**`r max(df2$wt)`**). 

```{r combine-tables, echo=FALSE}
final_data <- rbind(df, df2)
```

Combining the two datasets, we have a total of **`r nrow(final_data)`** subjects. The revised average weight is **`r round(mean(final_data$wt), 2)`** (range: **`r min(final_data$wt)`**-**`r max(final_data$wt)`**). We now have **`r final_data %>% filter(class == 'Group 1') %>% nrow()`** subjects in Group 1, **`r final_data %>% filter(class == 'Group 2') %>% nrow()`** subjects in Group 2, and **`r final_data %>% filter(class == 'Group 3') %>% nrow()`** in Group 3.

## Plotting the data {#sec:2}

As Rmarkdown documents can do anything R can do, we can also create and include figures. Here we plot boxplots of our clinical trial data. The data are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-data). Note that this figure number (as well as the table numbers above) are automatically generated. 

```{r plot-data, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Weight distribution of clinical trial subjects", fig.height=3, fig.width=4}
final_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = class, y = wt, color = class)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.25) + 
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Weight") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

# Methods{#methods}

The following code was used in section \ref{sec:1} to create the original clinical trial data:

```{r show-trial-data-1, eval=FALSE, ref.label='subject-weights'}
```

The following code was used in section \ref{sec:2} to plot the data:

```{r show-fib-1, eval=FALSE, ref.label='plot-data'}
```
